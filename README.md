Life Expectancy Prediction Using Apache Spark

Introduction:

Forecasting life span is vital in public health research, aiding in understanding population health trends and shaping policies to enhance general well-being. This undertaking employs Apache Spark, a robust framework for handling large amounts of data, to forecast life expectancy through sophisticated machine learning techniques, focusing particularly on Random Forest Regression.
Objective:
 The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that can predict life expectancy with precision by utilizing various socio-economic and health factors. We analyze large datasets of up to 200,000 records efficiently by utilizing Apache Spark's distributed processing capabilities to uncover insights on the factors that impact life expectancy.

Methodology:

Data Collection: We gather comprehensive datasets from reputable sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), encompassing various factors affecting life expectancy, including demographic indicators, healthcare expenditure, and disease prevalence.
Data Preprocessing: Pre-model training, we undertake essential data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to ensure dataset quality and relevance for analysis.
Model Development: Utilizing Apache Spark's diverse machine learning libraries, we develop a Random Forest Regression model. This ensemble learning technique combines predictions from multiple decision trees to enhance accuracy.
Evaluation: The developed model undergoes rigorous evaluation using cross-validation techniques to assess its performance and accuracy in predicting life expectancy. Comparative analysis with traditional linear regression methods provides insights into its effectiveness.
Results:

Our analysis demonstrates that the Random Forest Regression model surpasses traditional linear regression techniques in predicting life expectancy, even with an expanded dataset comprising up to 200,000 records. Despite slightly longer execution times in Spark, attributed to its distributed file system architecture, the model exhibits high accuracy and efficiency in processing extensive datasets.

Conclusion:

This project underscores Apache Spark's potential as a robust platform for life expectancy prediction, even with significantly expanded datasets. By leveraging big data analytics, we can enhance our understanding of life expectancy determinants and develop targeted interventions to improve global health outcomes.
